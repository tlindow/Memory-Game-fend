# Memory Game Project

This repository was forked from sandraisrael's memory game project. Modals were added after matched cards and theme colors were changed.

## What is the Memory Game
This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons.

## Instructions
* Click on a card

* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time


## How I built the Memory Game
I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game
